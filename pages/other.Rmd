# What else was on our minds?  

In one homework assignment, students were asked to web scrape quotes from the [Brainy Quote](https://www.brainyquote.com/ "Brainy Quote") website.  What terms did we search?  What quotes did we find?

### Searched terms

```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
Stat231_PS5_info <- read_excel("C:/Users/kcorreia/Dropbox (Amherst College)/Teaching/Spring 2020/Stat231/Calendar Project/Stat231_PS5_info.xlsx") 

Stat231_PS5_info2 <- Stat231_PS5_info %>%
  filter(is.na(Quote_Search)==FALSE & str_detect(Quote_Search, "NONE") == FALSE)

tb <- table(c(Stat231_PS5_info2$Quote_Search, "winston churchill", "resilience"))

set.seed(15)
wordcloud(names(tb), as.numeric(tb)
          #, min.freq=20
          #, max.words=50
          # plot the words in a random order
          , random.order=T
          # specify the range of the size of the words
          , scale=c(4,2)
          # specify proportion of words with 90 degree rotation
          , rot.per=.15
          # colors words from least to most frequent
          # blues
          , colors = c("#2171b5","#6baed6","#aaaaaa", "#000066", "#00004c")
          # font family
          , family="sans")
          #, vfont = c("sans serif", "plain"))
```


### Quotes

<span style="color: #4b55ad;">

```{r, comment=NA}
#devtools::install_github("kbodwin/demoR")
#library(demoR)

quotes0 <-  read.csv("C:/Users/kcorreia/Dropbox (Amherst College)/Teaching/Spring 2020/Stat231/Calendar Project/all_quotes.csv") %>%
  filter(person != "KAT") %>%
  mutate(together = paste('"', as.character(quote), '" --'
                          , as.character(person), sep=""))

for (i in 1:length(quotes0$together)){
  cat(quotes0$together[i], "\n \n")   
}

```

</span>

### What's the temperature where we are? Using Google's BigQuery API

In one homework assignment, students connected to [Google's BigQuery
API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data "BigQuery Public Data")
to access a public dataset containing weather information collected by
NOAA. They identified a weather station in the state or country in which
they were currently residing, and plotted the average temperature by
month in their location.

\[\[include figure that is overlays of students submission on
temperature by month in their location from PS5\]\]\[\[note the range in
avg. temps for April/current month\]\]

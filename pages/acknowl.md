Thank you to Albert Kim (Smith College) and Johanna Hardin (Pomona College) for the Google
Calendar project idea. They credit Roger Peng’s and Hilary Parker’s Not So Standard Deviations
podcast titled [“Compromised Shoe Situation”](http://nssdeviations.com/size/5/?search=shoe "Not So Standard Deviations podcast"), in
which they discuss a data science design challenge on getting to work on time, for the inspiration.

The title of this project is a play on the **Diary of a Wimpy Kid** book series.  Kat and her kids were
reading A LOT of those books in her house during COVID-19 isolation.  Many of the titles in the series felt equally applicable
here:
- Diary of a [Data Science Student]: Cabin Fever
- Diary of a [Data Science Student]: The Last Straw
- Diary of a [Data Science Student]: The Ugly Truth
- Diary of a [Data Science Student]: Hard Luck
- Diary of a [Data Science Student]: The Long Haul
- Diary of a [Data Science Student]: Old School
- The [Data Science Student] Do-It-Yourself Book

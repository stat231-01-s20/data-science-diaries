How is Breanna spending her time these days?  Unfortunatey, not singing with her Amherst College DQ group (pictured above)!  But, she has managed to fit in *some* singing during quarantine.  

Visit [Breanna's web page here](https://brichards21.github.io/calendar-project/ "Breanna Richards"){:target="_blank"} to read her diary entry (and see some fun gifs)!

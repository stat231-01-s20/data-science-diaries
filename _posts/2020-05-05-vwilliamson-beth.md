When I asked students what they're doing on a daily basis to keep humor in their lives these days, more than a handful recommended TikTok as a good outlet for some laughter.  How much time have *you* been spending on TikTok during quarantine?  How much time has Beth been spending on TikTok during quarantine?  In her diary post, Beth analyzes how her leisure time is spent, and also assesses how her time is spent on each of her classes.

Visit [Beth's web page here](https://ewilliamson22.github.io/Calendar-Project/ "Beth"){:target="_blank"} to read her diary entry, and see how her leisure time breaks down between screen vs. non-screen leisure activities!

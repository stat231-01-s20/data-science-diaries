Among the many changes and challenges of remote learning, Isabelle focuses on one of the positives that came out of this experience: "the huge changes between my life before and after COVID-19 has meant one thing. More! Data! To! Analyze!"  In her diary entry, Isabelle addresses two main questions:

- How did I divide my time before and after the shift to learning among my academics and other activities?  
- How has the change in timezone change the way in which I schedule my time between the morning and the evening?

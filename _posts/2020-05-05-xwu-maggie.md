In her Diary of a Data Science Student: How to Avoid Dog Days post, Maggie seeks to answer questions about her productivity during quarantine, including:

- What conditions allow me to be more productive?  
- How does the type of assignment (math homework or essay writing) affect my productivity levels?
- How does the work area (bed or desk) affect my productivity level?

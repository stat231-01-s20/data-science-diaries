In her diary post, Stephanie writes, "Since I attend Amherst College, a small liberal arts institution that emphasizes the importance of small, in-person classes for fostering an intimate, intellectual environment, this was a difficult transition for various reasons. I function in my school environment and home environment very differently, so I knew that I would have to make some changes to my home environment in order to retain my motivation and focus for my schoolwork. I decided that creating a strong sense of structure would be most effective for my learning, since my days on campus were very structured. In order to maintain this structure, I decided that I would create a schedule every morning when I wake up, and try my best to stick to it."

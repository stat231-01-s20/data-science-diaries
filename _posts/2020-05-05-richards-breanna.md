Dear Reader,

Most people look forward to Spring Break. But, for Amherst students and many college students across the country, the start of Spring Break 2020 marked a fundamental change in our lives. For those whose circumstances allowed, we would be sent home to ride out the rest of the semester in quarantine.

This diary is dedicated to answering the basic question: “how do I spend my time?”

For 14 days straight, I used Google Calendar to schedule my time. I primarily used two different calendars, my intended schedule, and my real schedule. More specifically, at the end of each day, I made a schedule of the tasks that I intended to do the next day, and when I intended to do them. Then, during the days, I would record what I actually did in a separate scheudule.
